## Introduction

This repo contains datastructure written in javascript, I've created it for the sake of explaining and studying data structure using javascript hence it's _javascript_ a little bit (or more)difference from other languages.

## Tips to Optimally Learn DS

those tips are not solid, but they've helped me alot, and I hope it will help you too

1. Learn Data structure concept
    - Draw it  
    - Create API/operation methods (Accessing Mechanisms)
2. Build the Data structure
    - Pseudocode the implementation
    - Code the data structure constructor
3. Utilize the Data structure
    - Put your data structure to work!
    - Pair it with an algorithm if needed
4. Understand Data structure
    - What is the time complexity?
    - How can you optimize it?
5. practice on leetcode.

## Application of Data structures

include here the application you've done as [path finder, Google Maps, etc]

  - Trees and Graphs

### A note

I've included some notes on each data structure, I encourage you to give it a look and read the #useful-readings sections of each data structure
