## Resources

The Best resource I've found so far was a great book by Nickolas zakas <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books/about/Understanding_ECMAScript_6.html?id=6Ze7DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">Understanding ECMAScript 6: The Definitive Guide for JavaScript Developers</a>

One of the other great resources which I personally check on regular basis is the <a href="https://2ality.com/index.html">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer Blog</a>, such a detailed explaination with amazing use cases and proofs, you will enjoy a lot
